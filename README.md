This investigation aims to determine key properties of asteroids to assess their suitability for asteroid mining. The indicators used to judge this include rotational period,
geometric albedo, mass, and volume. Three asteroids were selected for observation; these
were 18172 (2000 QL7), 162723 (2000 VM) and 99248 (2001 KY66). Unfortunately, unfavourable weather conditions throughout November 2019 meant that we were unable to
observe these targets, instead, archival data available thanks to Sean McGee and the JPL
Horizons database were used. Despite being unable to observe these targets, the criteria
for asteroid selection as well as the reduction procedure was still applicable for the archival
data, hence being described in section 2.1. 694 Ekard was chosen as a backup target and its
rotational period, geometric albedo and diameter were found to be 5.87+2.71
−1.02h, one standard
deviation away from online predictions, 0.025 ± 0.001, one standard deviations from online
predictions, and 121.891 ± 3.657 km agreeing with predictions to 3d.p respectively.
